# Alkemy Disney API

#### This is a project created as part of the AlkemyLabs Node.Js Challenge. 
_
### Objective
The objective of this challenge was to create a RESTful API with Node.js using Express.js, following REST patterns and conventions.

### Approach taken 

The API was built using a TDD(Test Driven Development) approach, using the tests as a central part of the process. 

### Documentation

This API allows to a registered user to do basic CRUD functions for Characters, Movies/Series and Genres. So in the first place you need to register a valid Email.
